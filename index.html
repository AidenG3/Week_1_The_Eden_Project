            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                    Ng began independently releasing tracks as The Eden Project in 2013, achieving popularity through promotion networks.
                     In 2014, he released the album Kairos, in which the tracks "Statues" and "Chasing Ghosts" saw him experimenting with
                      a more subdued alternative style of music. In October 2014, he released the Entrance EP, whose indie track "Circles"
                       contrasted his familiar electronic style. His most popular tracks were deviations from his usual sound. On 10 December 2014,
                        he was featured on the track "Scribble" by New York-based producer Puppet, which was released through Monstercat. </p>

                In 2015, Ng further embraced his indie style with the Bipolar Paradise EP, whose track "Fumes" has amassed over 15 million views on YouTube
                 as of January 2019.[8] He later announced that he was discontinuing The Eden Project, and released Final Call, his last EP under the alias.
                  It contained two covers, one of "Blank Space" by Taylor Swift and the other of "Crazy In Love" by Beyonc√©. "Times Like These" is officially
                   the last song released under his former alias.
